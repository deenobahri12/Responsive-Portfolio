      <p>My name is Deeno Shamsul-Bahri, I'm a personal trainer attending a Coding Boot Camp at the University of Minnesota. I live in Uptown Minneapolis, originally from south Minneapolis.  </p>

      <p>I've been coding since december 2017 and have been hooked ever since. The first language I learned was Python and worked with the framewok Django. Going into the BootCamp, I knew we would be learning JavaScript so I switched gears to JavaScript 3 months's out from the program so I could get more familiar with JavaScript, as well as the MERN stack associated with JavaScript. </p>

      <p>With this new material I'm learning, I'm in the process of building multiple Web and Mobile apps.  </p>
